## Challenges
Here are some of the biggest challenges I have encountered during this project.

### Scroll snap
Getting the initial layout of the page to work as intended was quite a big problem in the beginning. 
I wanted something that worked similarly to [Tesla's website](https://www.tesla.com), with each project having its own "snap".
I did not initially know that CSS had this built into it and tried using JavaScript. 
This solution worked but was a bit laggy in some browsers which had me looking for other solutions, this is when I found the CSS Scroll Snap.
